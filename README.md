Match transaction IDs from the client file to the VLOOKUP local file and create specific supplier data containing the Response ID present in the local file. Copy all the data points from the client file, including all major reasoning minus the transaction ID.

This will help efficiently and easily share the data to  specific suppliers when there are multipleâ€”possibly more than 20 suppliers.
